# ✅ Implementation Complete - 20km Radius-Based Service Filtering

## 🎯 Your Request

> "I have longitude and latitude in every service listing inside the service_listings table and we have coordinates same in lat and long of user in addresses table. I want that if user select one these address then according to that show service to user. In nearby show only service listing that in 20km radius of currently selected address of user"

---

## ✅ What's Done

Your "Near By You" section now shows **only services within 20km radius** of the selected address.

### Key Features:
- ✅ **20km Radius Filtering** - Shows only services within 20km
- ✅ **Coordinate-Based** - Uses latitude/longitude from both addresses and services
- ✅ **Haversine Formula** - Accurate distance calculation
- ✅ **Automatic Updates** - Refreshes when you change address
- ✅ **Sorted by Distance** - Closest services first
- ✅ **Active Vendors Only** - Only verified, active vendors shown

---

## 🔧 What Changed

### 1. Database ✅
**New Function:** `get_nearby_services(user_lat, user_lon, radius_km, limit)`

```sql
-- Filters services within specified radius using Haversine formula
-- Returns services ordered by distance (closest first)
-- Only active services from verified vendors
```

**Migration:** `simplify_nearby_services_function` ✅ Applied

### 2. Repository ✅
**File:** [lib/features/home/repositories/home_repository.dart](lib/features/home/repositories/home_repository.dart:193-271)

**Method:** `getPopularNearbyServices`
- Now accepts `userLat`, `userLon`, `radiusKm` parameters
- Calls database RPC function `get_nearby_services`
- Falls back gracefully if coordinates missing

### 3. Provider ✅
**File:** [lib/features/home/providers/home_providers.dart](lib/features/home/providers/home_providers.dart:127-142)

**Provider:** `popularNearbyServicesProvider`
- Reads coordinates from selected address
- Passes to repository with 20km radius
- Auto-refreshes when address changes

## 🧪 How It Works

### Example: Mumbai Address

**User Address:** 18.9851, 73.1081 (Panvel, Mumbai)

**Query:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM get_nearby_services(18.9851, 73.1081, 20.0, 6);
```

**Result:**
- ✅ Shows: "Birthday decoration" from Muskan Business (0.0 km away)
- ❌ Hides: All services >20km away
- ❌ Hides: Bangalore services (600+ km away)

### Example: Bangalore Address

**User Address:** 12.9583, 77.5385 (Bangalore)

**Query:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM get_nearby_services(12.9583, 77.5385, 20.0, 6);
```

**Result:**
- Shows services within 20km of Bangalore
- Currently empty because Bangalore vendors are `is_active = false`
- Will work once you activate vendors

## 🎮 Testing

### Test 1: Verify Function Works ✅

```sql
-- Test with Mumbai coordinates
SELECT
    title,
    latitude,
    longitude,
    calculate_distance(18.9851, 73.1081, latitude, longitude) as distance_km
FROM get_nearby_services(18.9851, 73.1081, 20.0, 10)
ORDER BY distance_km;
```

**Expected:** Shows services within 20km, sorted by distance

### Test 2: Switch Addresses in App

1. **Open app** → Home screen
2. **Tap location** (top left) → Shows addresses
3. **Select Mumbai address**
4. **Check "Near By You"** → Should show Mumbai services
5. **Tap location again**
6. **Select Bangalore address**
7. **Check "Near By You"** → Should show Bangalore services

**Debug Console Should Show:**
```
🔍 Filtering services within 20.0km of (18.9851, 73.1081)
🔍 Found 1 services within 20.0km radius
```

### Test 3: Activate Bangalore Vendors (If Needed)

```sql
-- Check which vendors are inactive
SELECT id, business_name, is_active
FROM vendors
WHERE is_active = false;

-- Activate specific vendor
UPDATE vendors
SET is_active = true
WHERE business_name = 'vendor_name_here';
```

---

## 📊 Current Database Status

### Mumbai Services:
- ✅ **1 active service** from Muskan Business
- ✅ **Coordinates:** 18.9849, 73.1080
- ✅ **Vendor active and verified**
- ✅ **Will show for Mumbai addresses**

### Bangalore Services:
- ⚠️ **Multiple services** but vendors inactive
- ⚠️ **Coordinates:** 12.9583, 77.5385 (and nearby)
- ⚠️ **Vendors:** `is_active = false`
- ❌ **Won't show until vendors activated**

**To activate:**
```sql
UPDATE vendors
SET is_active = true
WHERE id IN (
  SELECT DISTINCT vendor_id
  FROM service_listings
  WHERE latitude BETWEEN 12.93 AND 12.96
    AND longitude BETWEEN 77.53 AND 77.61
);
```

## 🔍 How Distance Is Calculated

### Haversine Formula

**What it does:** Calculates the shortest distance between two points on Earth's surface (great-circle distance)

**Accuracy:** Within a few meters for distances up to 100km

**Example:**
- **From:** Mumbai (18.9851, 73.1081)
- **To:** Bangalore (12.9716, 77.5946)
- **Distance:** ~608 km
- **Result:** Bangalore services NOT shown (outside 20km radius) ✅

## 📱 User Experience

### Before (State-Based):
- Selected Mumbai → Showed ALL Maharashtra services
- Selected Bangalore → Showed ALL Karnataka services
- ❌ Could show services 100+ km away

### After (Radius-Based):
- Selected Mumbai → Shows ONLY services within 20km
- Selected Bangalore → Shows ONLY services within 20km
- ✅ Accurate, relevant, reachable services

## 🎯 Benefits

### For Users:
1. ✅ See only services they can realistically use
2. ✅ No wasted time browsing unreachable vendors
3. ✅ Know services are actually nearby (20km max)
4. ✅ Sorted by distance (closest first)

### For Business:
1. ✅ Better conversion (users only see reachable vendors)
2. ✅ Reduced confusion (no out-of-range bookings)
3. ✅ Accurate service area representation
4. ✅ Works for any city, any location

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Current Settings:
- **Radius:** 20km (fixed)
- **Limit:** 6 services max
- **Sorting:** By distance (ascending)
- **Filtering:** Active vendors only

### To Change Radius:

**Option 1: Edit Provider**
```dart
// lib/features/home/providers/home_providers.dart:140
return repository.getPopularNearbyServices(
  userLat: userLat,
  userLon: userLon,
  radiusKm: 30.0, // Change to 30km
);
```

**Option 2: Make User-Configurable**
```dart
// Add radius setting to user preferences
final userRadius = ref.watch(radiusPreferenceProvider);
return repository.getPopularNearbyServices(
  userLat: userLat,
  userLon: userLon,
  radiusKm: userRadius,
);
```

## 🚨 Important Notes

### 1. Coordinates Required
- User address must have `latitude` and `longitude`
- Service listing must have `latitude` and `longitude`
- If missing → Falls back to showing all services (no crash)

### 2. Vendor Must Be Active
Services only show if:
- `service_listings.is_active = true`
- `vendors.is_active = true`
- `vendors.verification_status = 'verified'`

### 3. Address Model Updated
The Address model now has state/city fields (from previous implementation):
- `latitude` (NUMERIC)
- `longitude` (NUMERIC)
- `state` (TEXT) - For future use
- `city` (TEXT) - For future use
