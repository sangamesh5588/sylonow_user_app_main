## Part 1: Create Release Keystore (One-Time Setup)

### Step 1: Generate Keystore

Open terminal and navigate to your project's android directory:

```bash
cd "/Users/arbazkudekar/Downloads/flutter projects/sylonow-user-app-1/android"
```

Generate the keystore:

```bash
keytool -genkey -v -keystore upload-keystore.jks \
  -keyalg RSA \
  -keysize 2048 \
  -validity 10000 \
  -alias upload
```

**You'll be prompted for:**
1. **Keystore password**: Create a strong password (save it!)
2. **Re-enter password**: Confirm password
3. **Key password**: Can be same as keystore password (save it!)
4. **What is your first and last name?**: Arbaz Kudekar (or your name)
5. **What is the name of your organizational unit?**: Sylonow
6. **What is the name of your organization?**: Sylonow Vision Private Limited
7. **What is the name of your City or Locality?**: Bengaluru
8. **What is the name of your State or Province?**: Karnataka
9. **What is the two-letter country code?**: IN
10. **Is this correct?**: yes

### Step 2: Create key.properties File

Create `android/key.properties` (this file is already in .gitignore):

```properties
storePassword=YOUR_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD_HERE
keyPassword=YOUR_KEY_PASSWORD_HERE
keyAlias=upload
storeFile=../upload-keystore.jks
```

**Replace:**
- `YOUR_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD_HERE` with your actual keystore password
- `YOUR_KEY_PASSWORD_HERE` with your actual key password

### Step 3: Backup Your Keystore

**CRITICAL: Backup these files securely!**

```bash
# Copy to safe location (USB drive, encrypted cloud storage, etc.)
cp upload-keystore.jks ~/Desktop/BACKUP_upload-keystore.jks
cp key.properties ~/Desktop/BACKUP_key.properties

# Create a text file with passwords
echo "Keystore Password: YOUR_PASSWORD" > ~/Desktop/BACKUP_passwords.txt
echo "Key Password: YOUR_PASSWORD" >> ~/Desktop/BACKUP_passwords.txt
```

⚠️ **WARNING:** If you lose your keystore, you CANNOT update your app on Play Store. You'll have to publish a new app with a different package name!

## Part 2: Build Release APK/Bundle

### Option 1: Build App Bundle (Recommended for Play Store)

```bash
cd "/Users/arbazkudekar/Downloads/flutter projects/sylonow-user-app-1"

# Clean build
flutter clean
flutter pub get

# Build app bundle
flutter build appbundle --release
```

**Output location:**
```
build/app/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab
```

### Option 2: Build APK (For testing or alternative stores)

```bash
# Build release APK
flutter build apk --release

# Or build split APKs (smaller size)
flutter build apk --split-per-abi --release
```

**Output location:**
```
build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk
```

### Build Verification

Check the build was signed correctly:

```bash
# For App Bundle
jarsigner -verify -verbose -certs build/app/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab

# For APK
jarsigner -verify -verbose -certs build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk

# Should say "jar verified" if successful
```

---

## Part 3: Test Release Build

### Step 1: Install on Physical Device

```bash
# Install release APK
flutter install --release

# Or manually install
adb install build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk
```

### Step 2: Test Critical Features

**Must test:**
- ✅ Login with phone OTP (SMS autofill should still work without manifest permissions)
- ✅ Google Sign-In
- ✅ Location services
- ✅ Camera access
- ✅ Photo picker
- ✅ QR code scanning
- ✅ Payment flow with Razorpay
- ✅ Firebase notifications
- ✅ Network requests to Supabase
- ✅ App doesn't crash on startup
- ✅ ProGuard didn't break anything

### Step 3: Check APK Size

```bash
# Check app bundle size
ls -lh build/app/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab

# Should be around 20-40 MB
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Build Fails with "key.properties not found"

**Solution:**
```bash
# Make sure file exists
ls -la android/key.properties

# If missing, create it (see Part 1, Step 2)
```

### "Failed to load keystore"

**Solution:**
- Check `storeFile` path in `key.properties`
- Ensure `upload-keystore.jks` exists in `android/` folder
- Verify password is correct

### "INSTALL_FAILED_UPDATE_INCOMPATIBLE"

**Solution:**
```bash
# Uninstall old debug version first
adb uninstall com.sylonowusr.app

# Then install release
flutter install --release
```

### ProGuard Issues (App Crashes)

**Solution:**
Check `android/app/proguard-rules.pro` and add keep rules:
```proguard
-keep class your.crashing.class.** { *; }
```

### APK Too Large

**Solution:**
```bash
# Build with split APKs
flutter build apk --split-per-abi --release

# Results in smaller APKs for each architecture
```
