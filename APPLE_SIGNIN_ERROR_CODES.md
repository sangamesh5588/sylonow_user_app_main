# Apple Sign In Error Codes - Quick Reference

## Error Code Progression

### ❌ Error 1000 → ✅ Error 1001 = **Good Progress!**

You went from **Error 1000** (configuration issue) to **Error 1001** (user canceled), which means:
- ✅ Apple Sign In is now properly configured
- ✅ The sign-in dialog appeared
- ✅ User dismissed/canceled it (this is normal!)

## Error Code Reference

| Error Code | Error Type | Meaning | User Impact | Fix Required |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **1000** | `unknown` | Configuration issue, missing redirect URL, or bundle ID mismatch | Cannot sign in | Yes - fix Supabase/Apple Developer config |
| **1001** | `canceled` | User tapped "Cancel" or dismissed the dialog | None - user chose not to sign in | No - this is normal behavior |
| **1002** | `failed` | Apple's servers failed to process the request | Cannot complete sign in | Retry, check network |
| **1003** | `invalidResponse` | Apple returned invalid data | Cannot complete sign in | Retry, contact support |
| **1004** | `notHandled` | Request not handled properly | Cannot complete sign in | Code issue |
| **1005** | `notInteractive` | Requires user interaction but none possible | Cannot complete sign in | Ensure UI is interactive |

## What Error 1001 Means

**Error 1001 = User Canceled** ✅ This is **NORMAL behavior**

When you see:
```
🍎 Apple Sign In Authorization Error: AuthorizationErrorCode.canceled
🍎 Error message: The operation couldn't be completed. (com.apple.AuthenticationServices.AuthorizationError error 1001.)
```

This means:
1. ✅ Apple Sign In is **working correctly**
2. ✅ The native Apple Sign In dialog **appeared**
3. ✅ User tapped **"Cancel"** or dismissed it
4. ✅ App handled it gracefully (no error shown to user)

**This is the expected behavior when a user doesn't want to sign in!**

## Current App Behavior

### When User Cancels (Error 1001)
- User taps "Continue with Apple"
- Apple's native sign-in dialog appears
- User taps "Cancel" or swipes to dismiss
- **Result**: User stays on login screen, no error message shown
- **Log**: Shows error 1001 for debugging purposes

### When User Completes Sign In (Success)
- User taps "Continue with Apple"
- Apple's native sign-in dialog appears
- User chooses to continue with their Apple ID
- **Result**: User is authenticated and redirected
- **Log**: Shows success messages with user ID

## Testing Scenarios

### Scenario 1: User Cancels (Error 1001)
```
User Action: Tap "Continue with Apple" → Tap "Cancel"
Expected: Return to login screen, no error message
Log Output:
  🍎 Starting Apple Sign In process...
  🍎 Apple Sign In Authorization Error: AuthorizationErrorCode.canceled
  🍎 Error message: ...error 1001...
```
✅ **This is working correctly!**

### Scenario 2: User Completes Sign In (Success)
```
User Action: Tap "Continue with Apple" → Choose Apple ID → Continue
Expected: Navigate to home or welcome screen
Log Output:
  🍎 Starting Apple Sign In process...
  🍎 Received credential from Apple
  🍎 User ID: <user_id>
  🍎 Email: <email>
  🍎 Identity Token available: true
  🍎 Successfully signed in to Supabase
  🍎 User ID: <supabase_user_id>
```
✅ **Try this to verify everything works!**

### Scenario 3: Configuration Error (Error 1000)
```
User Action: Tap "Continue with Apple"
Expected: Error message shown
Log Output:
  🍎 Starting Apple Sign In process...
  🍎 Apple Sign In Authorization Error: AuthorizationErrorCode.unknown
  🍎 Error message: ...error 1000...
```
❌ **You had this before - now it's fixed!**

## Troubleshooting Flow

```
Error 1000 (unknown)
    ↓
Fix Supabase configuration
    ↓
Error 1001 (canceled) ← YOU ARE HERE ✅
    ↓
Actually complete the sign-in (don't cancel)
    ↓
Success! User authenticated
```

## What Changed to Fix Error 1000 → 1001

The progression from 1000 to 1001 indicates that one or more of these worked:

1. ✅ **Supabase Configuration**: Apple provider is enabled with correct settings
2. ✅ **Client IDs**: Bundle ID is correctly configured in Supabase
3. ✅ **Redirect URL**: Callback URL matches between Apple and Supabase
4. ✅ **Code Updates**:
   - Added nonce generation
   - Improved error handling
   - Better logging

## Next Steps

Since you're now getting Error 1001 (canceled), that means **Apple Sign In is working!**

### To Verify Complete Success:

1. **On Simulator**:
   - Apple Sign In button should be hidden (this is correct)
   - Test with Google or Phone sign-in

2. **On Real Device** (when available):
   - Tap "Continue with Apple"
   - **Don't tap Cancel**
   - Choose your Apple ID
   - Tap "Continue"
   - Watch for success logs
   - You should be signed in!

## Summary

| Status | Error | What It Means |
|---|---|---|
| ❌ Before | Error 1000 | Apple Sign In not configured properly |
| ✅ Now | Error 1001 | Apple Sign In works, user just canceled |
| 🎯 Next | Success | User completes sign in (don't cancel) |

**Your Apple Sign In is now properly configured!** The error 1001 you're seeing is just because the sign-in was canceled, which is completely normal user behavior. 🎉

When you actually complete the sign-in flow (don't tap cancel), it should work perfectly!
