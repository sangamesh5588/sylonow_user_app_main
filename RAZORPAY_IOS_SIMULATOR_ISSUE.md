# Razorpay iOS Simulator Issue - IMPORTANT

## The Problem You're Experiencing

You're seeing:
1. ✅ Razorpay order is created successfully
2. ✅ `_razorpay.open()` is called without errors
3. ❌ **Razorpay payment UI does NOT appear**
4. ❌ Orders are being created without payment

## Root Cause

**Razorpay Flutter SDK does NOT work on iOS Simulators**

This is a **known limitation** of the Razorpay Flutter SDK:

### Platform Support:
- ✅ **Android Emulators** - WORKS
- ✅ **Real Android Devices** - WORKS
- ✅ **Real iOS Devices** (iPhone/iPad hardware) - WORKS
- ❌ **iOS Simulators** - **DOES NOT WORK**

You are testing on **iPhone 17 Pro Max simulator**, which is why the Razorpay UI is not appearing.

## Why This Happens

The Razorpay native iOS SDK requires certain hardware capabilities and permissions that are not available in iOS Simulators. When you call `_razorpay.open()` on a simulator:
- The method executes without throwing an error
- But the native iOS payment UI fails to initialize
- No visual feedback is provided to the user
- The callbacks are never triggered

## What I've Fixed

### 1. Fixed Processing State Management
**File**: `lib/features/booking/screens/checkout_screen.dart`

**Before**:
```dart
await razorpayService.processPaymentWithCallback(...);
setState(() {
  isProcessing = false; // ❌ Immediately stopped processing
});
```

**After**:
```dart
await razorpayService.processPaymentWithCallback(...);
// NOTE: Do NOT set isProcessing to false here!
// Payment is async - it will be handled by callbacks
// isProcessing will be set to false in the callbacks
```

### 2. Added Processing State Reset in Callbacks
- `onPaymentSuccess`: Already navigates to success screen (no reset needed)
- `onPaymentFailure`: Now properly resets `isProcessing = false`

### 3. Added iOS Simulator Warning
The app now logs a warning when running on iOS in debug mode:
```
⚠️ WARNING: You are running on iOS Simulator. Razorpay payment UI may not appear.
⚠️ For testing Razorpay, please use:
   1. A real iOS device (iPhone/iPad)
   2. An Android emulator
   3. A real Android device
```

## Solutions for Testing

### Option 1: Test on Real iOS Device (RECOMMENDED)
1. Connect your iPhone or iPad via USB
2. Select it as the target device in Xcode/VS Code
3. Run the app: `flutter run`
4. The Razorpay payment UI will work correctly

### Option 2: Test on Android Emulator
1. Open Android Studio and start an emulator
2. Or use: `flutter emulators --launch <emulator_name>`
3. Run: `flutter run`
4. The Razorpay payment UI will work correctly

### Option 3: Test on Real Android Device
1. Enable USB debugging on your Android phone
2. Connect via USB
3. Run: `flutter run`
4. The Razorpay payment UI will work correctly

## Testing Checklist

Before testing payments, ensure:

1. ✅ You're NOT using an iOS Simulator
2. ✅ You have a valid address selected
3. ✅ Your profile has name and phone number filled
4. ✅ You're using the correct Razorpay API keys (currently LIVE keys in code)
5. ✅ The app has been fully rebuilt (not hot reload)

## Expected Payment Flow

When testing on a **supported device**:

1. User taps "Pay" button
2. Debug log: `💳 Initiating payment: ₹{amount}`
3. **Razorpay UI appears** with payment options:
   - UPI
   - Credit/Debit Cards
   - Net Banking
   - Wallets
4. User completes payment
5. On success:
   - Debug log: `✅ Payment completed: {paymentId}`
   - Debug log: `✅ Order created: {orderId}`
   - Navigates to `/booking-success/{orderId}`
6. On failure:
   - Debug log: `❌ Payment failed: {error}`
   - Shows error snackbar
   - Button becomes clickable again

## Current Configuration

### Razorpay Package Version
- **Current**: `razorpay_flutter: 1.3.7`
- **Reason**: More stable than v1.4.0

### API Keys (in code)
- **Key ID**: `rzp_live_RSUaC7MqY7BfsZ`
- **Key Secret**: `Cc2vEjqs2SATSz0uI10TYLi7`
- **⚠️ WARNING**: These are LIVE keys. Use test keys for development!

### Payment Split
- **Advance Payment**: 60% of total amount
- **Remaining Payment**: 40% (to be collected later)

## Files Modified

1. ✅ `lib/features/booking/screens/checkout_screen.dart`
   - Fixed processing state management
   - Added iOS simulator warning
   - Fixed payment failure callback

2. ✅ `lib/features/booking/services/razorpay_service.dart`
   - Enhanced error handling
   - Added comprehensive logging
   - Added 300ms delay before opening Razorpay

3. ✅ `pubspec.yaml`
   - Downgraded to `razorpay_flutter: 1.3.7`

## Debugging Payment Issues

If Razorpay still doesn't work on a real device:

### 1. Check Logs
Look for these debug prints:
```
💳 Initiating payment: ₹{amount}
🚀 [RAZORPAY] Opening Razorpay checkout with options: ...
🚀 [RAZORPAY] Payment amount: {amount} paise
🚀 [RAZORPAY] Order ID: order_XXX
✅ [RAZORPAY] Razorpay.open() called successfully
⏳ [RAZORPAY] Waiting for payment UI to appear...
```

### 2. Android-Specific Checks
- Verify CheckoutActivity is in AndroidManifest.xml ✅ (already done)
- Verify CheckoutTheme in styles.xml ✅ (already done)
- Do a full rebuild: `flutter clean && flutter run`

### 3. iOS-Specific Checks
- **Ensure you're on a REAL device, not simulator**
- Check Razorpay pods are installed: `cd ios && pod install`
- Clean Xcode build: `cd ios && xcodebuild clean`
- Full rebuild: `flutter clean && flutter run`

## Known Limitations

1. **iOS Simulators**: Will never work with Razorpay
2. **Test Mode**: If using test API keys, only test payment methods will work
3. **Live Mode**: Current keys are LIVE - real money will be charged!

## Recommendation

**For Development**:
1. Switch to Razorpay TEST keys
2. Test on Android emulator or real Android device
3. Use real iOS device only for final testing before production

**For Production**:
- Keep using LIVE keys (current setup)
- Ensure all testing is done on real devices
- Add backend server to handle Razorpay API calls (currently done from app)

## Security Note

⚠️ **CRITICAL SECURITY ISSUE**: Your Razorpay Key Secret is currently hardcoded in the app (`razorpay_service.dart`). This is a security risk.

**Recommendation**: Move Razorpay order creation to your backend server:
1. Backend creates Razorpay order
2. Backend returns order_id to app
3. App uses order_id to open Razorpay checkout
4. No secrets exposed in app code

## Next Steps

1. **Test on a real device or Android emulator**
2. **Switch to test API keys** for development
3. **Consider backend implementation** for order creation
4. **Remove sensitive keys** from app code
